## About JobTracker
We all tend to open a bunch of tabs while doing the job hunting but sometime we do not have enough time to apply all in at once and keep those tabs open will occupy a lot of memory spaces. It is a Chrome extension that helps you track web pages (especially, job links that you want to save and apply later)

## Getting Started
1. Download all codes from this repository.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/, and turn on the developer mode.
3. Click "Load Unpacked" to upload the entire JobTracker folder.

## Functions
1. Can manually type the URL to the input field, then click SAVE INPUT button.
2. Click the SAVE TAB button, JobTracker will fetch the URL of the current tab.
3. **Double click** the DELETE ALL button can clear all URL stored in the localStroage.
4. After clicking the link, the new tab will be opened and the corresponding URL will be popped from the JobTracker.
