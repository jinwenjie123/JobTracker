## About JobTracker
We all tend to open a bunch of tabs while doing the job hunt but sometime we do not have time to apply all in at once and keep those tabs open will occupy a lot of memory spaces. It is a Chrome extension that helps you track web pages (especially, Jobs that you want to save and apply later)

## Getting Started
1. Download all codes from this repository.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/, and turn on the developer mode.
3. Click "Load Unpacked" to upload the entire JobTracker folder.
